And so they have… since the 1980s. The latest is THE Batman, starring Robert Pattison as the Caped Crusader, directed by Matt Reeves.\n\nThe Batman definitely raises a few questions. Like what inspired them to cast Robert Pattinson and Colin Farell? Are these going to get even DARKER? Why doesn’t anyone aim for Batman’s mouth? How freakin’ long is this movie? Why was it a shock to find out that the criminal guy was a liar and a bad guy? What was that green juice that saved the entire day at the end? What is that suit even made of?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to The Batman!

When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is \"fixer\" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts \"criminal\" in \"criminal lawyer.\"\n\n#BetterCallSaul #Season6 #Sony\n\nOfficial Season 6 Trailer | Better Call Saul\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/breakingbad/featured",
